Metroid Fusion Freedom

Incomplete hack of Metroid Fusion with non-linear progression. It uses the Japanese version to include difficulty options and extra ending images. The main goals were a new event system, stackable weapons, and removal of story elements. Most of the goals were implemented except for parts of the event system.
